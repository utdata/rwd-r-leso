With each update, check the “Austin MSA agencies” in the analysis notebook.\nThis notebook processes data by the Defense Logistics Agency about military surplus transfers to local law enforcement through the Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) or LESO Program.\nThe data is updated quarterly. As of this date, the file name is linked from the headline “ALASKA - WYOMING AND US TERRITORIES”.\nThe spreadsheet has a a sheet for each state. This notebook puts all the sheets together into a single dataset for easier analysis.\nThere is some cleaning done here based on June 2022 research. See the README."

    "text": "Exploring non-controlled property\nAfter exploring controlled vs non-controlled property, I corresponded with the DLA in June 2022.\nQuestion: Is there a way to tell from the data itself if the item is a controlled vs non-controlled item? I thought perhaps the DEMIL IC field with value of “A” might be non-controlled, but there seem to be items older than a year with that categorization that could be controlled and accurately remain, like RECON SCOUT XT,SPEC and AIRPLANE,CARGO-TRANSPORT.\nAnswer: Property with the DEMIL codes A and Q6 are considered non-controlled general property and fall off the LESO property books after one year. All other Demil codes are considered controlled items and stay on the LESO property book until returned to DLA for disposition/disposal.\nFollowup question: When you say Q6, do you mean a demil_code of “Q” combined with demil_ic of “6”. Would other property with demil_code “Q” but with a demil_ic of other numbers not be controlled? Second question: In the 22Q2 data, there are a number of items older than a year (n = 62) that are DEMIL CODE A and DEMIL IC 1 and they do seem like big items that might be “controlled”. Some examples: RECON SCOUT XT,SPEC (ALABAMA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, 2016-08-25) and AIRPLANE,CARGO-TRANSPORT (ARIZONA DEPT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, 2015-12-03, $17,000,000). I could see the argument for them to be controlled (though SEAT,AIRCRAFT might be a maybe on that).\nFollowup answer: The general rule is that property coded A and Q6 (6 being the integrity code) falls off the LESO property book after one year. However, there are some exceptions. For instance, aircraft are always controlled regardless of the demil code. Also, LESO has the discretion to keep items as controlled despite the demil code. This happens with some high value items. The RECON SCOUT XT, SPEC example you cited was actually initially coded incorrectly because the wrong NSN was used when it was coded as A. Once the correct NSN was verified with the manufacturer, is was renamed and recoded as D. The next quarterly report will reflect the new name and code.\nSo … If we exclude non-controlled, we should keep aircraft.\nExploring the demil_code as possible angle.\n\nleso |&gt; \n  count(demil_code)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nLook at combination of demil_code and demil_ic (integrity code)\n\nleso |&gt; \n  count(demil_code, demil_ic)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nLooking at demil code docs perhaps “A” is our value. (It is, as confirmed by DLA.)\n\nleso |&gt; \n  filter(demil_code == \"A\") |&gt; \n  count(item_name, acquisition_value)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis is looking reasonable.\nOK, are there any “Old” A records?\n\nleso |&gt; \n  filter(demil_code == \"A\") |&gt; \n  count(year(ship_date))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhat are the old ones?\n\nold_controlled &lt;- leso |&gt; \n  filter(\n    (demil_code == \"A\" | (demil_code == \"Q\" & demil_ic == 6)),\n    date(ship_date) &lt; \"2021-03-21\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  select(state, agency_name, item_name, quantity, acquisition_value, demil_code, demil_ic, ship_date)\n\nold_controlled\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nsmallest value?\n\nold_controlled |&gt; \n  filter(!(str_detect(item_name, \"AIR\"))) |&gt; \n  summarise(min(acquisition_value))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nold_controlled |&gt; arrange(acquisition_value)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFrom this and discussions with the DLA we know this:\n\nThe RECON SCOUT XT,SPEC records are an error. They should’ve been classified as “D”.\nAnything with AIRCRAFT should be retained. This is why AIRPLANE,CARGO-TRANSPORT is still on the list. Probably why SEAT,AIRCRAFT is as well, though perhaps needlessly.\nOther ’high value” A/Q6 records might need to be retained. Maybe that is why TRUCK,STAKE and RECEIVER,INFRARED remain?\n\nHoe does this compare to the most recent year (as of 22Q2).\n\nnew_AQ6 &lt;- leso |&gt; \n  filter(\n    (demil_code == \"A\" | (demil_code == \"Q\" & demil_ic == 6)),\n    date(ship_date) &gt;= \"2021-03-21\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  select(state, agency_name, item_name, quantity, acquisition_value, demil_code, demil_ic, ship_date)\n\nnew_AQ6\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n,\n\nnew_AQ6 |&gt; \n  filter(acquisition_value &gt; 40000)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nWorking out non-controlled exclusion\nAs of right now, I would exclude these items like this:\n\nThis doesn’t take aircraft or expensive items into account.\n\n\nnon_controled_explore &lt;- leso |&gt; \n  filter(\n    (demil_code == \"A\" | (demil_code == \"Q\" & demil_ic == 6))\n  ) |&gt; \n  select(agency_name, item_name, demil_code, demil_ic)\n\nnon_controled_explore"
